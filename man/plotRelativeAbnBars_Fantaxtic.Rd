\usage{
plotRelativeAbnBars_Fantaxtic(
  phobj,
  variable = "Condition",
  topn = 15,
  tax_level = "Genus",
  outname = "GenusBarplotFx.pdf",
  height = 7,
  width = 12,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{phobj}{A \code{phyloseq} object containing microbiome data.}

\item{variable}{Character string indicating the sample metadata variable used to facet the barplots (e.g., "Condition"). Default: 'Condition'}

\item{topn}{Integer indicating the number of top abundant taxa to include in the plot. Remaining taxa are grouped as "Other". Default: 15}

\item{tax_level}{Taxonomic level to aggregate by (e.g., "Genus", "Family", etc.). Default: 'Genus'}

\item{outname}{Output file name for saving the plot as a PDF. Default: 'GenusBarplotFx.pdf'}

\item{height}{Height of the output PDF plot in inches. Default: 7}

\item{width}{Width of the output PDF plot in inches. Default: 12}

\item{wespalette}{Name of the Wes Anderson color palette (from \code{wesanderson} package) to use for coloring the taxa. Default: 'AsteroidCity1'}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the stacked barplot of relative abundances.
}
\description{
Plots a barplot of the top \code{n} most abundant taxa at a given taxonomic level using the \code{fantaxtic} package, optionally grouped by a sample variable and colored with a custom Wes Anderson palette.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{fantaxtic} to prepare and plot relative abundance data of the top
taxa across sample groups. The top \code{n} taxa are
extracted using \code{get_top_taxa}, and "Other" groups all remaining taxa.
The final barplot is faceted by the \code{variable}, and colored using a selected palette
from the \code{wesanderson} package. The plot is saved to PDF and also returned as a \code{ggplot}
object for further manipulation.
