\title{Get Relative Abundance and Prevalence Table}
\usage{
getRelAbundanceTab(phobj)
}
\arguments{
\item{phobj}{A phyloseq object containing microbiome count data and taxonomy.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item Prevalence: number of samples where taxa is present (count > 0)
\item TotalAbundance: sum of counts across all samples
\item Taxonomy columns from the phyloseq object's tax_table
\item relative_prevalence: prevalence divided by total number of samples
}
}
\description{
Calculates prevalence and total abundance of taxa from a phyloseq object and returns a data frame with taxonomy information.
}
\details{
Prevalence is calculated as the count of samples in which each taxon has a non-zero abundance.
Total abundance is the sum of counts across all samples.
Relative prevalence is the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
This function works for phyloseq objects with taxa as rows or columns.
