\title{Create and Save a Volcano Plot from Differential Expression Results}
\usage{
make_volcano(res, opt, name, pcol = "pvalue")
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A data frame or matrix containing differential expression results,
including \code{log2FoldChange} and p-value columns.}

\item{opt}{A list or object containing analysis options, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{pval}: numeric, significance threshold for p-values.
\item \code{fc}: numeric, fold-change cutoff.
\item \code{out}: character, output directory to save the plot PDF.
}}

\item{name}{Character. Filename for the output PDF volcano plot.}

\item{pcol}{Character. Name of the p-value column to use for significance (default \code{"pvalue"}).}
}
\value{
The \code{EnhancedVolcano} plot object (invisibly returned after saving the PDF).
}
\description{
Generates a volcano plot using the \code{EnhancedVolcano} package based on
differential expression results, and saves the plot as a PDF file.
}
\details{
The function attempts to create a volcano plot with labeled points from the row names
of \code{res}. It highlights significant genes or taxa based on p-value and fold-change
thresholds provided in \code{opt}. The plot is saved to a PDF file in the specified
output directory.
