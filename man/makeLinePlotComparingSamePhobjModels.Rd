\arguments{
\item{phname}{Name of the phyloseq object (used to subset the \code{all_model_results} list)}

\item{all_model_results}{A named list of model results, containing sublists for different feature selection strategies
(e.g., 'padj_taxa_res' and 'praw_taxa_res'), each with a \code{modummary} data frame.}

\item{opt}{A list containing output options, specifically \code{opt$out} for the output directory path.}

\item{w}{Width of output PDF file, in inches. Default: 8}

\item{h}{Height of output PDF file, in inches. Default: 12}

\item{get_pcnames_from}{Name of the feature selection strategy to extract variable names and model summary from. Default is \code{"padj_taxa_res"}.}

\item{plot_extra}{Whether to include additional models (e.g., LinDA) in the comparison plots. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plot_indiv}{Whether to include individual species models in the comparison. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{plot_normal_with_smote}{Whether to also plot SMOTE-enhanced models for comparison. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{filter_out}{Vector of model names to exclude from plots (e.g., "Ensemble2"). Default is \code{c("Ensemble2")}.}

\item{order_by_measure}{The metric used to order models and selection strategies (e.g., \code{"Accuracy_l1out"}). Default is \code{"Accuracy_l1out"}.}

\item{from_smote}{Whether the models being processed are already from SMOTE-based selection. Adjusts which object names are used. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{name}{String prefix used for naming the output folder and files. Default is empty string \code{""}.}

\item{sel_method_name}{Label to assign to the main selection strategy (used in plots). Default is \code{"PCA DESeq"}.}
}
\value{
This function saves multiple PDF files with comparison plots of model metrics, as well as a TSV file
summarizing the combined model results. It returns no R object.
}
\description{
This function compares model performance across two feature selection strategies, each performed on features selected from different phyloseq objects.
(e.g., padj-selected and raw p-value-selected taxa). It extracts accuracy results from model summaries,
merges them, and generates a faceted line plot comparing model performances for each group.
The resulting data and figure are saved to disk.
}
\details{
This function is useful when comparing different sets of selected features on the same dataset,
especially when assessing feature selection strategies such as raw vs. adjusted p-value filters.
It supports optional inclusion of LinDA-based selections and SMOTE-augmented models.

The following plots are generated and saved:
\itemize{
\item Bar plots of Accuracy across models.
\item Line plots for Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Kappa, Balanced Accuracy, and AUC.
\item Several combined panels in different layout configurations (e.g., 2- or 4-panel plots).
}
All files are written to a subfolder named based on \code{phname} and \code{name} in the output directory.
