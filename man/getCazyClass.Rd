\title{Map CAZy Families to CAZy Classes}
\usage{
getCazyClass(cazy_tt)
}
\arguments{
\item{cazy_tt}{A character vector of CAZy family strings, where each string
may contain one or multiple CAZy family codes separated by "|". Each family code
starts with a two-letter prefix (e.g., "GH", "GT").}
}
\value{
A character vector with the CAZy class names corresponding to each family code
extracted from the input vector. The output is of the same length as the total number
of family codes found (splitting by "|").
}
\description{
Given a character vector of CAZy family identifiers separated by pipes ("|"),
returns the corresponding CAZy class names based on the CAZy classification system.
}
\details{
The function extracts the first two letters of each CAZy family code to map it
to one of the main CAZy classes:
\itemize{
\item GT: GlycosylTransferases
\item GH: Glycoside Hydrolases
\item PL: Polysaccharide Lyases
\item CE: Carbohydrate Esterases
\item AA: Auxiliary Activities
\item CB: Carbohydrate-Binding Modules
}

The input strings can contain multiple families separated by "|".

\dontrun{
if(interactive()){
  families <- c("GH13|GT2|PL9", "CE4", "AA3|CBM50")
  getCazyClass(families)
