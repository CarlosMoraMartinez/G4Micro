\usage{
makeConstrainedOrdinationSingleVar(
  phobj,
  variables = c("Condition"),
  dist_type = "bray"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phobj}{A phyloseq object containing microbiome data and sample metadata.}

\item{variables}{A character vector of variables to include in the ordination formula. Default is \code{c("Condition")}.}

\item{dist_type}{Distance metric to use for ordination. Default is \code{"bray"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the constrained ordination plot with environmental variables as arrows.
}
\description{
Performs a constrained ordination (CAP) on a phyloseq object using specified variables.
Uses the \code{\link[phyloseq]{ordinate}} method with the CAP method.
}
\details{
The function removes samples with NA in the first variable specified, calculates the distance matrix,
performs CAP ordination constrained by the variables, and plots the ordination with points colored by the first variable.
Environmental variables are added as arrows with labels.
Note: This function is redundant with \code{makeConstrainedOrdination}, but this one allows to plot CAP with only 1 variable, whereas the other one needs more than 1.
