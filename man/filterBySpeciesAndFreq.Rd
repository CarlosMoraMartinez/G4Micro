\title{Filter Species-Level Processes by Count and Frequency}
\usage{
filterBySpeciesAndFreq(df, opt)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble with functional pathways as rows (first column named "Pathway")
and numeric counts or abundances in the subsequent columns.}

\item{opt}{A list containing filtering parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{mincount}: Minimum count threshold to consider a value as present.
\item \code{minsampleswithcount}: Minimum number of samples that must have counts above \code{mincount}.
}}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame retaining only rows where:
\itemize{
\item \code{Pathway} contains "|" indicating species-level resolution.
\item \code{Pathway} does not contain "UNINTEGRATED", "UNMAPPED", or "UNGROUPED".
\item The count is above \code{mincount} in at least \code{minsampleswithcount} samples.
}
}
\description{
Filters a functional matrix data frame to retain only species-level processes
(identified by the presence of "|" in the pathway name), excludes unwanted categories,
and retains rows with sufficient counts across samples.
}
\details{
This function focuses on species-level pathway abundances, filtering out ambiguous or unassigned entries
and ensuring that pathways are sufficiently represented across samples.
It assumes the first column of \code{df} is named "Pathway" and contains pathway identifiers.
