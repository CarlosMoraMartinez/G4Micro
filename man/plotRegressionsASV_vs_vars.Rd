\arguments{
\item{df3}{Data frame containing ASVs and variables.}

\item{asvs}{Character vector of ASV column names to plot as response variables.}

\item{vars2cor}{Character vector of variable column names to use as predictors.}

\item{groupvar}{Name of the grouping variable in \code{df3}, default is "Psoriasis".}

\item{group_levels}{Levels of the grouping variable, default is c("no", "yes").}

\item{groupnames}{Names to use in plot titles for each group, default is c("Control", "Psoriasis").}

\item{xlabel}{Label for the x-axis, default is "log(pg/mL)".}

\item{outdir}{Output directory to save plots, default is "" (current directory).}

\item{name}{Filename for the saved plot PDF, default is "regr.pdf".}

\item{w}{Width of the output plot(s) in inches, default is 7.}

\item{h}{Height of the output plot(s) in inches, default is 14.}

\item{opt}{List of additional options to pass to the plotting/saving function.}
}
\value{
A named list of ggplot objects, one for each ASV.
}
\description{
Creates scatterplots with linear regression fits of ASVs against variables of interest,
faceted by variable, and separated by group.
}
\details{
The function creates separate regression plots for each ASV against all variables in \code{vars2cor},
faceted by variable, and plots them separately for the two groups defined in \code{groupvar}.
The regression line includes equation, RÂ², p-value, and sample size using \pkg{ggpmisc}.
Plots for each group are combined side-by-side using \pkg{cowplot}.
