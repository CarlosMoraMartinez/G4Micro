\title{Compare Model Accuracies Across Multiple Conditions for a Single Phyloseq Object}
\usage{
makeLinePlotComparingSamePhobjModels_Cov(
  phname,
  condnames,
  all_model_results,
  name,
  opt,
  w = 8,
  h = 12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phname}{Name of the phyloseq object (used to subset \code{all_model_results}).}

\item{condnames}{Character vector with the names of different feature selection conditions or experimental groups to compare.}

\item{all_model_results}{A nested list of model results. The top-level list is indexed by phyloseq object names,
and the second level is indexed by condition names (e.g., "padj_taxa_res", "raw_taxa_res"), each containing a \code{modummary} data frame.}

\item{name}{Prefix used to name the output plot file.}

\item{opt}{A list containing output options. Must include the \code{opt$out} directory path.}

\item{w}{Width of the output PDF file in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{h}{Height of the output PDF file in inches. Default is 12.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the accuracy comparison plot. Additionally, a TSV file and a PDF plot are saved to disk.
}
\description{
This function compares classification model accuracies across several conditions
(e.g., groups of selected features or experimental groups) for a given phyloseq object.
It aggregates model summaries from a list of results, formats them, and generates a line plot of accuracies.
A TSV file with all model summaries is also saved.
}
\details{
The function loops through the specified conditions, extracts the model accuracy summaries for each,
appends metadata for plotting, merges all results into a single table, and generates a line plot
showing accuracy (Accuracy_l1out) across different models and conditions.

The y-axis shows accuracy, the x-axis shows model type, and lines/points are grouped by condition.

Output files are saved in a subdirectory named after the \code{phname}, within the path specified by \code{opt$out}.
