\title{Perform Mediation Analysis with Multiple Predictors Merged into a Single Model}
\usage{
makeMediationSimple_mergedX(df, xnames, yname, medname)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the variables involved in the mediation model.}

\item{xnames}{A character vector with the names of the independent variables.}

\item{yname}{A character string indicating the name of the dependent (outcome) variable.}

\item{medname}{A character string indicating the name of the mediator variable.}
}
\value{
A data frame with mediation effect estimates, standard errors, z-scores, p-values, and matched x variable labels for each path.
}
\description{
Runs a simple mediation model where multiple independent variables (\code{xnames})
affect a single mediator (\code{medname}), which in turn affects the dependent variable (\code{yname}).
The function constructs the equations dynamically and calculates direct, indirect, and total effects using the Sobel test.
}
\details{
This function supports multiple independent variables by dynamically constructing the mediation equations. It uses the \code{bmem.sobel} function from the \code{bmem} package to estimate mediation effects and returns both the indirect and total effects per variable. Useful for simple mediation power calculations or exploratory analyses.

The function adds a \code{x_labels} column to indicate which independent variable each effect corresponds to.

Note: This function is designed for continuous or dichotomous outcomes and assumes linear relationships.
