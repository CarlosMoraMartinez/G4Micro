\title{Filter Taxa by Raw p-value and Fold Change Threshold}
\usage{
filter_taxa_praw(resdf, plim = 0.05, fc = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{resdf}{A data frame containing differential abundance or expression results. Must include
columns \code{pvalue} (adjusted p-value), \code{log2FoldChangeShrink} (log2 fold change), and \code{taxon} (taxon names).}

\item{plim}{Numeric cutoff for p-value to select significant taxa. Default is 0.05.}

\item{fc}{Numeric minimum fold change threshold (non-log scale). Taxa with absolute log2 fold change
greater or equal to \code{log2(fc)} are selected. Default is 1 (i.e., any change).}
}
\value{
A character vector of taxa names meeting the p-value and fold change criteria.
}
\description{
Filters taxa from a differential expression results data frame based on a significance threshold
(raw p-value) and a minimum fold change.
}
\details{
This function extracts taxa that pass both an unadjusted p-value cutoff and a fold change threshold.
Fold change is evaluated on a log2 scale, so the input \code{fc} is converted internally.
