\title{Filter Functional Processes by Count and Frequency}
\usage{
filterWholeProcessesAndFreq(df, opt)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing functional pathways as rows
and samples as columns. The first column should be named "Pathway".}

\item{opt}{A list containing filtering thresholds:
\itemize{
\item \code{mincount}: Minimum count threshold to consider a value as present.
\item \code{minsampleswithcount}: Minimum number of samples that must have counts above \code{mincount}.
}}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame retaining only rows meeting the criteria:
\itemize{
\item The \code{Pathway} does not contain the "|" character (i.e., whole processes).
\item The \code{Pathway} does not contain "UNINTEGRATED", "UNMAPPED", or "UNGROUPED".
\item Rows where the count is above \code{mincount} in at least \code{minsampleswithcount} samples.
}
}
\description{
Filters a functional matrix data frame to retain only whole (non-combined) processes,
excludes unwanted categories, and retains rows with sufficient counts across samples.
}
\details{
This function removes aggregated or ambiguous pathways and filters rows based on count thresholds.
It assumes that \code{df} has pathways in the first column named "Pathway" and numeric counts in other columns.

\dontrun{
if(interactive()){
  opt <- list(mincount = 5, minsampleswithcount = 3)
  df_filtered <- filterWholeProcessesAndFreq(df, opt)
