\title{Run scImpute on OTU Table}
\usage{
calc_scImpute(otutab)
}
\arguments{
\item{otutab}{A count matrix or data frame of raw counts (e.g., OTU table) with samples as columns and features as rows.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{outliers}{Output from the scImpute function, typically sample or cell outlier information.}
\item{imputed_counts}{A data frame of counts after imputation by scImpute.}
}
}
\description{
Performs dropout imputation on count data using the scImpute package.

The function writes the OTU count table to a CSV file, runs scImpute with specified parameters,
and reads back the imputed count matrix. It returns the outlier samples identified and the imputed counts.
}
\details{
The function writes the input counts to a temporary CSV file \code{"test_input.csv"}, runs scImpute with default parameters
(including dropout threshold 0.5, Kcluster=2, and 4 cores), and reads the imputed counts from \code{"scimpute_count.csv"}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
if(interactive()){
  # Assuming 'counts' is your OTU count matrix:
  result <- calc_scImpute(counts)
  head(result$imputed_counts)
}
}

}
