\title{Zero Imputation of Compositional Data Using zCompositions}
\usage{
getZCompositionImputedData(phobj, prevalence_lim = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{phobj}{A phyloseq object containing the OTU table.}

\item{prevalence_lim}{Numeric threshold for prevalence filtering.
Taxa with prevalence (proportion of samples with count > 0)
below this value are removed. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with zeros imputed using multiplicative replacement, with taxa in rows and samples in columns.
}
\description{
Filters taxa based on prevalence and imputes zeros using the multiplicative replacement method from the \pkg{zCompositions} package.
}
\details{
This function filters taxa based on prevalence, then imputes zeros using \code{cmultRepl} from \pkg{zCompositions}.
Note that \code{cmultRepl} expects samples as rows and taxa as columns, so the OTU table is transposed accordingly before and after imputation.
